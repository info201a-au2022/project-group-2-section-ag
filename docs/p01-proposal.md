## Abstract

We are concerned with the increasing rate divorce, because it affect the societies. To address this concern, we plan to use the dataset to understand the cause of divorce and use that to improve long-lasting relationship.

## Keywords
**Divorce rate**, **relationship**, **marriage**

## Introduction
The primary purpose of this project is to determine the reason for constantly improving the divorce rate and how to help people in today’s society build long-lasting relationships. Several problems that might cause divorce could be classified as lack of companionship, not enough common goals or life passions, domestic violence or cheating, etc. In this project, we will analyze the dataset about the divorce rate of the nation and the cause of divorce survey to form a complete data visualization that could provide audiences with a comprehensive understanding of what behaviors or practices might directly weaken the relationship with each other during marriage and what behaviors should be avoided in order to build a long-lasting relationship. Also, the project will compare and contrast the devoice rate in different areas to determine if the geographical locations and local environment have significant affection on marriage. Finally, the project will combine those two factors to show the audience what could be the leading cause of divorcing in a specific area.

## Problem domain

We are focusing on divorce and the divorce rate in our nation is the third highest in the world. Reducing divorce and building a long-lasting marriage is our goal.
When a marriage fails that will cause a lot of problems. First, the couple who are getting a divorce is affected. Those problems could be the happiness of the two couples, their mental health, and According to Bloomberg news “ recently separated or divorced adults have higher resting blood pressure.” which is affecting their health and the way of their life. Their divorce will also change their finances which will lead to lower household income, which will change their lives and leads to stress, depression, and anxiety. The people who are affected by the divorce are not only the couple. The divorce will affect their children too. There are many ways children are affected by divorce. For example, they may withdraw socially, their grades might suffer, they feel separation anxiety, their eating and sleeping patterns change, and they go through depression. These are some of the problems caused by divorce in a lot of children across the nation. Those children growing up in single-parent will affect the way they live their lives in the future. Past that divorce has had an economic impact on the nation. The government has been funding for more than two decades to research to find a way to predict with about 90 % accuracy which engaged couples will divorce. For example according to the National Bureau of Economic Research the Bush Administration's recent proposal to Congress for $300 million a year for counseling and other efforts to encourage and support marriage. And  Some states, including Arizona, Arkansas, and Louisiana, created optional "covenant marriages" that make it harder for couples to divorce. Solving this divorce problem and keeping families together will solve any problem that societies face. Including the problem that we have mentioned above, like the mental heath of the couples and their children

## Research questions

As social media becomes more and more popular in modern society, activity organizers and social applications enable our interpersonal communication to expand, and we are more likely to associate with people who share similar interests and values or are attracted to us. Do people still tend to have long-lasting relationships when they notice their differences from their spouses and have more chances to  meet people that they think are more appropriate in terms of forming relationships?

Maintaining a long-lasting relationship requires patience and effort. A trifle between a couple could become fierce wrangling or even divorce when handled improperly. Sometimes people overthink and make exaggerated judgments. Sometimes people blurt out hurtful words. These make people reconsider if they share the same values with their partners or if the marriage is not ideal as they anticipate. What is the correlation between divorce and the ways couples deal with deteriorative conversation?

Companionship is also a key factor in a satisfactory marriage. Couples who travel together and spend time at home may feel happier and be less likely to divorce than those who don’t.  How significant is the role of companionship in a marriage?

People from different places or cultures may conduct differently in relationships. Some places are believed to have a lower divorce rate than others. Factors such as finance, crime, culture, and religion may be included. What place has a relatively low or high divorce rate?

## The dataset

Based on our dataset, to address the first problem, by collecting results of relationship and value related questions from the couples and whether they have divorced, we could arrive at the answer through offering the statement, “I know we can ignore our differences, even if things get hard sometimes”, and asking their scale of coincidence. If the data shows there are more divorced couples who don’t believe they can neglect their differences than those who are still married. Then we can conclude that people are less likely to have long-lasting relationships because more than half of people can’t  overcome the differences they have, and they may find someone appropriate and compatible. The second question can be answered by investigating how many married and divorced people evaluate, “if one of us apologizes when our discussion deteriorates, the discussion ends.” If the result shows there are more divorced couples who do not coincide when one apologizes, and discussion ends, than married ones, we could know that clinging on deteriorative conversation is another major cause to divorce. Third, companionship can be tested through statements such as, “the time I spent with my wife is special for us”, “we don’t have time at home as  partners”, “we are like two strangers who share the same environment at home rather than family”, etc. If both have and value the time spent together in a relationship, and the married ones rank higher  on these questions than those who have divorced, we could know companionship is essential to a marriage. Finally, our dataset displays divorce rates in different countries, which implicitly illustrates the impact of finance, crime, culture, and religion on marriages. By comparing and arranging the divorce rates in different places, we could realize the places with relatively low and high divorce rates.

The provenance of our dataset is UCI ML Repository. The data was collected by Dr. Mustafa Kemal Yöntem, Dr. Kemal ADEM, Prof. Dr. Tahsin İlhan, and lecturer Serhat Kılıçarslan, on July 24th, 2019 for the purpose of predicting divorce using correlation.
The data collection was funded by the National Science Foundation, and marriage and family therapists are likely to profit from the data. Others can use the dataset as reference. The data was collected and tested by senior scholars and stored in UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was one of the oldest and most credible archives for data storage. The data was obtained in Kaggle searching by the key word, “divorce”, and was credited in this project under Acknowledge.

## Expected implications

Once this project is completed, it will directly provide married couples who have marriage or relationship problems an opportunity to self-check and target the main issue that occurred in a relationship. It also offers psychologists or sociologists who do research about long-term healthy relationships creditable data sets. As mentioned above, social media has consistently become the primary way for people in today's society to build their personal relationships. Therefore, The data from this project could help designers and technologists for future social media or dating apps to strengthen the matching system to avoid potential unhealthy relationships that might occur in the future. Last but not least, the policymakers could focus on analyzing the data from this project and utilize them to make policy that diminishes the divorce rate and encourages long-term relationships. One example could be local policymakers deciding to strengthen the punishment for domestic abusers because domestic violence is the main reason people in that area get divorced.

## Limitations
One limitation we need to address in order to make this project accurate and credible could be limited "divorce reasons" data from the internet. Even though we classify the "divorce reasons" into three main categories, we all know that relationship problems can be complex, and some issues that could cause divorce might not be found within those three main categories. For the purpose of providing credible data for the future, we have to cover the majority of reasons that might cause divorce. The second elimination could be finding ways to combine different data sets to form a conclusion. It will be a complicated process to make sure all the data is accurate and determine if it is suitable to combine two data sets together. One example is that it will not outcome a valid conclusion if we put the 2021 US divorce rate data set with the 2009 US divorce reasons data set.
